            <h5> Week 1: Make a Space. This week your task is to create a simple webpage and get it online. Create a digital space for you and your peers to inhabit. Whatever symbolic space you want it to be is up to you: It can be an art gallery, a library, a park, a high rise, a night club, a water tower, a studio, you name it.</h5>
            <h6> Week 2: Put some more things in your space. This week you will put some “things” in your space. Using just HTML and CSS, draw three items that would go into your space. They can be linked as separate pages or integrated into your main page. Consider how these things are related both conceptually and formally.</h6>
            <h7> Week 3: Add a bookshelf to your space. Find a text related in some way to the themes you’ve been exploring in your space. Create a separate HTML page where you typeset that text and link it from your main space. Here you are expected to consider the structure, form, and typography of your piece. Make sure you include a bibliographic reference to your source (use whichever citation formatting style you prefer).</h7>
       
            <h8> Project One</h8>
            <h9> For your first project this semester, you will be tasked with developing a large-format 2D composition inspired by some aspect of your life under COVID19. How has it changed? What have you lost contact with? What have you gained contact with? Think of ways to represent your life under current conditions.</h9>
